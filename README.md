# RESEARCHGATE, BERLIN PROGRAMMING CHALLENGE

## Sample Streamed Data

```
Please write a program stream-sampler that receives and processes an input stream consisting of 
single characters. The stream is of unknown and possibly very large length and the program should
work regardless of the size of the input. The program should take the sample size as a parameter 
and generate a random representative sample using that many characters.

```

> As for receiving the data the tool should work with two kinds of inputs:

1. Values piped directly into the process using cat input.txt | stream-sampler 5
2. values generated by using a random source from within the language


```
Clean and maintainable code, efficiency, memory consumption, and good testing are all important 
criteria we would like you to keep in mind when completing the challenge. Try to keep the maximum 
allocated memory as low as feasible.
```

> Should something about the challenge be unclear please make an assumption and document it.

> Example

```
Given a sample size of 5 and the following stream of characters as values: THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG
A possible random sample could be: EMETN

Example execution and output for piped processing:
$ dd if=/dev/urandom count=100 bs=1MB | base64 | stream-sampler 5
Random Sample: EMETN
```
# SOLUTIONS

> Two solutions are being implemented using Java programming language.

```
1. RESERVOIR SAMPLING

The random sample is generated from the stream using Reservoir Sampling algorithm designed by Knuth in 1997. 
The sampling is done using Java 8 Collector implementation.

2. MINHEAP SAMPLING

The random sample is generated from the stream using MinHeap datastructure.
